    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Weekly learning progression. -> Goal: Show change/growth over time. -> Viz: Line Chart (Chart.js) showing "Cumulative Knowledge" vs. Week. -> Interaction: Hovering over points shows a tooltip with the week's theme. -> Justification: Provides an immediate, motivating visual summary of the learning journey. -> Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: Full 7-week curriculum. -> Goal: Organize and inform. -> Presentation: Interactive vertical timeline with expandable sections for each week. -> Interaction: Clicking a week in the nav bar scrolls to it; clicking the section header toggles the visibility of its detailed content (objectives, projects, resources). -> Justification: Breaks down a large large amount of text into manageable chunks, promoting focused learning and preventing cognitive overload. -> Method: HTML/CSS/JS with Tailwind.
        - Report Info: Required Hardware List. -> Goal: Inform. -> Presentation: A dedicated grid of cards. -> Interaction: Each card represents a component with a link to purchase. -> Justification: A clean, organized, and actionable presentation of required materials. -> Method: HTML/CSS with Tailwind.
        - Report Info: Key Concepts/Projects per week. -> Goal: Inform/Organize. -> Presentation: Styled lists and text within the expandable weekly sections. -> Interaction: None, focuses on readability. -> Justification: Clear and direct presentation of core learning materials. -> Method: HTML/Tailwind.
